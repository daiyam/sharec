    +section('Installation')
      p
        | If you want to install #[strong sharec] just use your lovely manager:
      +code('bash')
        | npm i --save-dev sharec
      p
        | Or with #[strong yarn]
      +code('bash')
        | yarn add -D sharec
      p
        | ‚ö†Ô∏è Install #[strong sharec] only in your configs directory!
    +section('Configuration')
      p
        | When you have installed #[strong sharec] you should modify your configuration #[strong package.json] with:
      +code('json')
        | "scripts": {
        |   "postinstall": "sharec"
        | }
      p
        | Then should create #[strong configs] directory and init npm package in it:
      +code('bash')
        | mkdir configs
        | cd ./configs
        | npm init -y
      p
        | After initialization you can install #[strong dependencies] right here ‚Äì in #[strong configs] directory.
      p
        | For example, you need to install #[strong eslint]. Exectute that commands in #[strong configs] directory:
      +code('bash')
        | npm i --save-dev eslint
        | eslint --init
      p
        | Answer on some questions and #[strong eslint] will be ready to share!
    +section('Sharing')
      p
        | So, now you can publish your config or just share it with github.
      +code('bash')
        | npm publish
      p
        | Just publish you config and install into your project.
      +code('bash')
        | cd my-awesome-project
        | npm install --save-dev my-awesome-config
        | npm install
      p
        | ‚ö†Ô∏è You should install new dependencies in "hand" mode!
      p
        | Configuration was applied! üôå
    +section('How it works')
      p
        | Sharec flow is really simple. There are some steps:
      ol
        li Copying configs from #[strong config] directory
        li Adding dependencies from #[strong config/package.json]
        li Seting inject status as true
      p
        | If you are already install config it will not be injected into your project and you will see warning message.
