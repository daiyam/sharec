      p
        | #[strong sharec] – is a new tool for sharing bloat and difficult configuration between many projects.
      p
        | With this tool you can place all your configuration files in single repository and install it with #[strong npm] or other package manager. That will make configuration process pretty simple.
    +section("Installation")
      p
        | You should create new package and install #[strong sharec] into as dependency.
      +code("shell")
        | npm i --save sharec # With npm
        | yarn add sharec     # Or with yarn
      p
        | Next step – add #[strong sharec] to #[strong postinstall] hook of your configs:
      +code("json")
        | {
        |   "name": "my-awesome-configs",
        |   "scripts": {
        |     "postinstall": "sharec"
        |   },
        |   "dependencies": {
        |     "sharec": "1.0.0"
        |   }
        | }
      p
        | All done! You are ready to create configs.
    +section("Configuration creating")
      p
        | After installing you must create #[strong configs] directory and init #[strong npm] here.
      +code("shell")
        | mkdir configs
        | cd ./configs
        | npm init -y
      p
        | Now, you allowed to create sharable configs! #[a(href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharec-demo-config") Check this simple example].
    +section("Configuration installation")
      p
        | When you will be ready to share – push your configs or publish at npm-registry. After publishing/pushin you can install new configuration to any project.
      +code("shell")
        | npm i --save-dev my-awesome-configs
      p
        | When configuration will be installed you can see a new entry in the project's `package.json` file:
      +code("json")
        | "sharec": {
        |   "injected": true
        | }
      p
        | It means – configs were injected and on the next `npm install` – `sharec` will not inject configurations again.
